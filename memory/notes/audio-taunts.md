# Audio taunt system (prop players)

Built 2026-07-16 (VRmike, branch build/100-audio-taunt-system-for), finishing an interrupted
attempt-1 tree (`0a3ce19` WIP-RECOVERY). Lets a prop play an audio taunt as DIRECTIONAL 3D audio at
its own world position for EVERYONE — hunters locate props by ear, so taunting is a deliberate
self-snitch. Allowed in any active phase (HIDING or HUNTING); a prop taunting while hiding only
hurts itself, so no special rule.

## The whole loop
prop presses taunt (T key on desktop / on-screen button on phones) → a large scrolling menu opens →
pick a taunt → client sends `C2S.TAUNT{id}` → host validates + broadcasts `S2C.EVENT kind:'taunt'`
tagged with who taunted → EVERY client plays the clip as `THREE.PositionalAudio` at that prop's live
position. The menu STAYS OPEN across picks (back-to-back spam is the intended feature); ✕ / T / Esc
close it. A STOP button appears while your own taunt plays and kills it for everyone.

## Data-driven library (ZERO code to add clips)
- `assets/taunts/manifest.json` = `{ taunts: [{ id, label, file }] }`. `id` unique+stable, `label` =
  menu text, `file` = path relative to `assets/`. The client loader (`js/taunts.js` `_url`) resolves
  it under `/assets/` and tolerates a leading `/` or an `assets/` prefix.
- **REAL CLIPS ARE WIRED IN (2026-07-16, build/112).** 29 real meme .mp3s VRmike/Teravortryx
  uploaded via Discord are registered in the manifest. They sit FLAT in `assets/` (e.g.
  `assets/Never_Gonna_Give_You_Up.mp3`) — that's where the canonical root `assets/manifest.json`
  + `CREDITS.md` register them — so the taunt manifest `file` fields are bare filenames
  (`"Never_Gonna_Give_You_Up.mp3"`), NOT `taunts/…`. There is no `assets/audio/` dir. LICENSE is
  UNVERIFIED on every clip (Discord attachments) — recorded in CREDITS.md.
- Adding more clips: drop the audio file into `assets/` and add one manifest line (id/label/file).
  NO code change. An empty/absent manifest is valid (menu shows the empty-state note; the host
  rejects every taunt id).
- **The 3 synthesized placeholder beeps (beep_high / beep_low / warble) were REMOVED** (VRmike) —
  their manifest entries are gone and `tools/gen-taunt-placeholders.mjs` is now a RETIRED no-op stub.
  Note: this sandbox has no shell/`rm` and `Write` can't touch binaries, so the stale
  `assets/taunts/beep_*.wav` files may still be on disk — nothing references them; delete in a normal
  commit if desired.

## Files / responsibilities
- **`shared/protocol.js`** — `C2S.TAUNT{id}`, `C2S.STOP_TAUNT`; `S2C.EVENT` kinds
  `taunt{by,id,uncancellable}` and `tauntStop{by}`.
- **`shared/referee.js`** (host-authoritative relay, same pattern as SHOOT):
  - `applyTaunt(player,id)` — accepts only a LIVING PROP in HIDING/HUNTING with a real manifest id
    (`_tauntIds` set built in the constructor from injected `config.taunts.taunts`), then broadcasts.
    A self-chosen taunt clears the uncancellable flag.
  - `applyStopTaunt(player)` — broadcasts `tauntStop`, UNLESS the current taunt was forced
    uncancellable (then the prop's stop button is a no-op).
  - `forceTaunt(propId)` — **FINDER-TOOL HOOK, dormant.** Forces a RANDOM taunt from a prop, marked
    `uncancellable:true` (their stop button can't kill it). The future prop-finder tool wires it in
    ONE line: `referee.forceTaunt(propId)`. The host picks the clip once + relays so every client
    plays the same one. Returns false on a non-prop / dead prop / empty library.
  - The cut-off rule is NOT enforced here — the referee just relays; each client cuts off per-emitter.
- **`js/config.js`** — loads the manifest into `cfg.taunts.taunts` (tolerant of absent/empty). Clips
  themselves are NOT fetched here.
- **`js/taunts.js` — `TauntLibrary`** (client lazy loader/cache): `load(id)` fetch+decode a clip on
  first use, caching the PROMISE (concurrent/repeat loads share one fetch); `prefetch()` loads the
  whole library in the background. Decodes via a passed `loadBuffer(url)` (→ `scene.loadAudioBuffer`)
  so it holds no THREE reference. NEVER preloads at join.
- **`js/scene.js`** — the positional-audio engine:
  - `AudioListener` parented to the CAMERA (so Web Audio's listener tracks the player's eye →
    real stereo direction). Created lazily on first taunt; survives buildWorld's `scene.clear()`
    (camera is re-added).
  - One `PositionalAudio` emitter per taunting player, keyed by player id, on a bare `Object3D` added
    to the scene and repositioned every frame (`updateTauntEmitters`, called from the render loop) to
    that player's live mesh position — so the taunt FOLLOWS a moving prop.
  - `playTaunt(playerId, buffer, {mapSize})` — CUT-OFF: stops this player's previous emitter first
    (one voice per prop); different players overlap. **INVERSE-SQUARE distance model** tuned to the
    map (Jie, 2026-07-18) — see the falloff section below. Never throws (audio must not break the game).
  - `stopTaunt(id)` / `clearAllTaunts()` / `loadAudioBuffer(url)` (AudioLoader → AudioBuffer, null on
    fail, Safari-safe) / `unlockAudio()` (resume the shared ctx inside a gesture, for iOS).
  - **buildWorld cleanup uses `_stopAllTaunts()`, NOT `.clear()`** — a PositionalAudio's source is a
    Web Audio node wired to the listener, NOT a scene-graph child, so removing the Object3D does NOT
    stop the sound. Clearing the map alone would leak a taunt into the next match.
- **`js/ui.js`** — DOM only, no game logic: `buildTauntList(taunts)` (data-driven rows from the
  manifest), `openTauntMenu`/`closeTauntMenu`, `setTauntButton`/`setTauntStop`; callbacks
  `onTauntButton/Pick/Stop/Close/Prefetch` injected by main.js. Rows fire on `pointerdown`.
- **`js/input.js`** — `T` key → `onToggleTaunt`, handled BEFORE the pointer-lock gate (like Backquote)
  so it opens while the mouse is captured AND closes while the menu has freed it. No-op on touch (the
  on-screen button covers it) / while typing.
- **`js/main.js`** — the glue:
  - `openTauntMenu`/`closeTauntMenu`: `state.tauntMenuOpen` is a UI-mode-like state that frees the
    DESKTOP mouse (exit pointer lock) so the scrolling list is clickable, WITHOUT opening pause.
    `onLockChange` returns silently on it (no overlay/pause), `openPause` supersedes it, and it's in
    the input-loop `halt` (movement zeroed while the menu is open). Touch skips the pointer-lock dance.
  - `sendTaunt(id)` relays `C2S.TAUNT` and unlocks audio in the gesture.
  - `onTaunt(msg)`: lazy-load the buffer → `scene.playTaunt`; for OUR OWN taunt show the STOP button
    (unless `uncancellable`) and auto-hide it when the clip ends. `onTauntStop(msg)` kills that
    player's emitter and hides our stop button.
  - `updateTauntUi()`: the taunt button shows for a living prop in an active phase; called from
    `applyToolView` (role/alive/scene rebuild) and the phase event. Full teardown in `backToMenu`.

## Distance falloff — inverse-square (Jie, 2026-07-18)
Replaced the old **linear** model (`refDistance ≈ size*0.08`, `maxDistance ≈ size*1.3`, rolloff 1)
with realistic **inverse-square** decay. Web Audio has no literal "inverse-square" `distanceModel`, but
the **exponential** model with `rolloffFactor = 2` IS exactly it: `gain = (d / refDistance)^-2`.
- Config in `playTaunt`: `setDistanceModel('exponential')`, `setRolloffFactor(TAUNT_FALLOFF_EXP)` (=2),
  `setRefDistance(size * TAUNT_FALLOFF_TARGET^(1/EXP))`. Two named knobs, one-line retunes:
  - `TAUNT_FALLOFF_TARGET = 0.03` — gain (fraction of full volume) at ONE MAP WIDTH away.
  - `TAUNT_FALLOFF_EXP = 2` — distance exponent; 2 = true inverse-square.
- The refDistance math: solve `(size/ref)^-EXP = target` → `ref = size * target^(1/EXP) = size * √0.03
  ≈ 0.1732 * size` (≈6.2 units on the 36-unit restaurant map). Full volume inside that radius,
  inverse-square beyond, exactly **3% at one map width**. Derived from `mapSize` so it's per-map generic.
- **`setMaxDistance` was REMOVED** — non-linear distance models silently IGNORE it, so leaving the old
  `size*1.3` in place would only mislead the next reader. (The linear model needed it to reach ~0.)
- **KNOWN TRADEOFF (intentional, not a bug to "fix"):** inverse-square never reaches true zero, so a
  taunt anywhere on the map stays **faintly audible (~3%)** instead of going fully silent like the old
  linear model did past maxDistance. That audible-everywhere realism is the whole point of the
  experiment Jie asked to try. If it proves annoying (hunters echo-locating props by the faint tail),
  the two knobs above dial it down cheaply, or revert to linear entirely.
- Asserted in `tools/check-taunts.mjs` §C: exponential model, rolloff 2, the two knobs, the
  `refDistance = size * target^(1/exp)` formula, `setMaxDistance` absent, and a numeric end-to-end
  check that gain lands at 3% one map width out.

## HRTF binaural panning (Jie, 2026-07-18)
Flipped positional taunts from Web Audio's default **equalpower** pan (cheap constant-power L/R only)
to **HRTF** (Head-Related Transfer Function — convolves a measured per-ear impulse response). On
headphones this gives true binaural 3D: real **front/back** and up/down cues that equalpower simply
cannot produce (before this, a taunt dead ahead and one dead behind sounded identical). Zero
dependencies — native to every browser's Web Audio engine; this is the realism step BEFORE any
external HRTF library.
- **Touch point:** `playTaunt` in `js/scene.js` sets `sound.panner.panningModel` on each
  `THREE.PositionalAudio` emitter (THREE exposes the underlying Web Audio `PannerNode` as `.panner`).
- **Guarded + fail-silent:** the assignment is in its OWN try/catch, OUTSIDE the emitter-create block.
  If `.panner` is missing or the set throws, we silently keep THREE's default equalpower pan and STILL
  play the taunt — audio must never throw (house rule).
- **CLIENT-SIDE knob, NOT shared/config:** module-level `TAUNT_PANNING = { model: 'HRTF', fallback:
  'equalpower' }` near the top of `js/scene.js`. This is how audio RENDERS on this machine, not
  authoritative game data, so it deliberately does not live in `shared/config/`. Applied value is
  `model || fallback`, so an empty/unset `model` degrades to equalpower rather than an invalid string.
- **Spec-exact spelling matters:** the Web Audio `PanningModelType` enum is `'HRTF'` (UPPERCASE) and
  `'equalpower'` (lowercase). Browsers SILENTLY IGNORE a wrong case (you'd get default panning and no
  error), so both strings are taken verbatim from the spec (verified against MDN), not from memory.
- **Mobile CPU caveat (the one real unknown):** HRTF costs a bit more CPU per emitter than equalpower,
  and the prop-finder's `forceTaunt` can drive ~5+ simultaneous taunt emitters. Desktop handles this
  trivially; a handful of HRTF panners is light on modern mobile too, but this was NOT verified on a
  real low-end phone under the worst case (headless boot can't measure audio CPU). If a weak phone
  ever stutters, the fix is to flip `TAUNT_PANNING.model` to the `fallback` value — globally, or
  gate it per-platform (desktop keeps HRTF, mobile → equalpower) — rather than reverting the feature.
- **Owed live pass:** one headphone listen in a real match — walk past a taunting prop and confirm the
  sound clearly moves front → side → behind you (the front/back distinction is the whole point), and
  spot-check ~5 simultaneous forced taunts on a phone for stutter.
- Asserted in `tools/check-taunts.mjs` §C: the `TAUNT_PANNING` knob exists (model HRTF, fallback
  equalpower), `playTaunt` sets `panner.panningModel = model || fallback`, reads `sound.panner` behind
  an `if (panner)` guard, and never hard-codes equalpower onto the panner.

## Master audio limiter (stop the clipping)
Every taunt emitter + `playUiSound` sums at THREE's shared `AudioListener` before the speakers, so
overlapping loud sounds can clip. A **master limiter** is spliced into the listener's single output
hop (`listener.gain → preGain → limiter → destination`) so the summed mix can't exceed 0dBFS. Taunt
emitters were trimmed from full `1.0` to `0.85` in `playTaunt` so the limiter stays a safety net.
This is purely the output graph — no change to the relay/cut-off/finder logic above. See
**`memory/notes/audio-limiter.md`** for the full design (incl. the "no true lookahead yet" rationale)
and `tools/check-audio-limiter.mjs`.

## Combat SFX reuse this positional path (B5, VRmike 2026-07-18)
The B5 combat sounds (gunshot / grenade blast / finder ping / size-pitched prop ouch) are built on the
SAME `AudioListener` → master-limiter graph and the SAME inverse-square + HRTF positional path as taunts.
`js/scene.js` gained **`playPositionalSound(pos, buffer, opts)`** — a fire-and-forget one-shot at a FIXED
world point (taunts follow a player; combat one-shots don't) with an optional `playbackRate` (the prop
ouch's pitch-by-size lever). It reuses the taunt falloff/HRTF/limiter wiring verbatim. See
**`memory/notes/combat-sfx.md`** + `tools/check-combat-sfx.mjs`.

## iOS / mobile
Audio unlocks only inside a user gesture on iOS. `scene.unlockAudio()` (resume THREE's shared
AudioContext) is called inside the menu-open and pick gestures. THREE's AudioLoader lazily creates
the same context, so decoding + playback ride the unlocked graph.

## UI placement (why top-centre)
The taunt + stop buttons sit TOP-CENTRE (just below the HUD pills). That band is clear of every other
touch control: joystick (bottom-left, tall), action/jump/rotate stack (bottom-right), pause ☰
(top-right corner), and the mid-screen banner (top:30%). Bottom-left/right were both taken.

## PC UX fixes (Jie, 2026-07-16, branch build/116-taunt-menu-pause-menu)
Keyboard-side polish; the mobile touch controls (on-screen Taunt button, floating stop) are UNTOUCHED.
- **Menu docks LEFT + NO tint.** `.taunt-menu` (css/style.css) is `justify-content: flex-start` and
  has NO `background`/`backdrop-filter` — the game world stays fully visible while the menu is open.
  The full-screen container still keeps `pointer-events: auto` so a stray click on empty space can't
  punch through to the canvas and re-lock the mouse (which would close the menu). The `.taunt-card`
  carries its own near-opaque background (`#170b28fa`) so it reads over the live world.
- **In-menu STOP button** (`#tauntStopInline`, in `.taunt-head`) silences your current taunt WITHOUT
  closing the menu — same `onTauntStop` → `C2S.STOP_TAUNT` path as the floating button. `setTauntStop`
  toggles BOTH buttons together, so the in-menu one shows only while your cancellable taunt plays.
- **Hotkey hint** `.taunt-hint` ("T / Esc to close") in the header; hidden on touch via
  `@media (pointer: coarse)` (the same primary-pointer signal input.js classifies control scheme by).
- **T already opens+frees the mouse in one press** (was true since the taunt system shipped — no
  tilde-first two-step). T or Esc closes and re-locks.
- **Esc TOGGLES the pause menu** (previously open-only). `main.js` `input.onRequestPause` now DERIVES
  the action from live state (derive-don't-latch): taunt menu open → `closeTauntMenu(true)`; pause open
  → `closePause(true)` (re-locks); else `openPause()`. The pointer-lock minefield is sidestepped because
  each of these Esc presses happens while the mouse is ALREADY free (menu/pause open ⇒ unlocked), so the
  Esc keydown reaches the page normally; the OPEN-from-play path still routes through the browser's
  lock-release → `onLockChange` → `openPause`. Locked⇔unlocked are mutually exclusive so the two paths
  never double-fire. Controls-help text (ui.js `_controlsHtml`) updated for the Esc toggle + a T row.
- `tools/check-taunts.mjs` section **D** asserts all of the above from source.

## Headless check — `tools/check-taunts.mjs` (build-gating, passes with the 29 real clips)
(A) manifest ids unique + every referenced file exists + library non-empty now. The check reads
ids DYNAMICALLY from the manifest (`taunts[0]`/`taunts[1]`), so it never assumed exactly 3 entries
and needed no logic change for 29 — only stale "placeholder" wording was updated. (B) drives the REAL
referee: taunt relayed to every player tagged by the taunter; a second taunt re-relayed; stop relayed;
hunter / dead prop / bogus id / lobby-phase all REJECTED; `forceTaunt` fires an uncancellable taunt and
the prop's stop is then ignored; a normal taunt clears the flag; empty library degrades gracefully.
(C) source assertions that scene/main/ui/config expose the audio API the render loop + event handler
call (the "a missing scene method silently kills the render loop every frame" lesson), the
inverse-square falloff knobs/formula, AND the HRTF panning setup (the `TAUNT_PANNING` knob + the
guarded `panner.panningModel = model || fallback` in `playTaunt`).

## Cut taunt audio on prop death (VRmike, 2026-07-20, build/216-stop-taunt-audio-on)
Playtest bug: when a taunting prop was killed, the clip kept ringing out until it finished. It now
cuts the INSTANT they die, on every screen in earshot (including the victim's own). The whole fix is
client-side audio bookkeeping riding the host's EXISTING authoritative death signal — no
server/referee change (the referee already broadcasts `eliminated{victim}` to everyone on any death,
via `_damagePlayer`). `scene.stopTaunt(playerId)` already existed and does exactly the right thing
(immediate stop + dispose of that player's emitter, safe no-op if silent), so this is pure wiring:
- **Death seam (the main one) — `js/main.js` `onEvent` `case 'eliminated'`:** calls
  `scene.stopTaunt(msg.victim)`. Because the `eliminated` event is broadcast to ALL clients, this
  cuts the dead prop's taunt on every phone/PC — and covers **self-death too** (the victim receives
  their own `eliminated`).
- **Self-death belt-and-suspenders — `js/main.js` `onSnapshot` alive→dead flip:** when the local
  snapshot flips `state.alive` true→false, also `scene.stopTaunt(state.selfId)`. The snapshot flip is
  a DISTINCT path that can arrive first (or alone, e.g. a non-attack health drain), so self-death is
  airtight regardless of which message lands first. Idempotent with the event path (double-stop is a
  no-op).
- **Silence seams (free, at existing teardown points):** round end (`case 'roundOver'` →
  `scene.clearAllTaunts()`), return-to-lobby (`backToMenu` already called `clearAllTaunts` — preserved),
  and a player disconnecting mid-taunt (`js/scene.js` `syncPlayers` removal loop now `stopTaunt(id)`
  before removing their mesh, so the sound doesn't chase a mesh that's about to vanish).
- **Headless guard — `tools/check-taunt-death-silence.mjs`:** drives the REAL referee (prop taunts →
  killed → asserts `eliminated{victim:PROP}` reaches every client), models the lifecycle against a
  faithful per-player-Map stand-in for the scene (taunt tracked → death event → stopped/disposed, dead
  prop only, bystander untouched, self-death stopped, silent-stop no-op), and source-asserts the REAL
  wiring at all four seams so the model isn't fiction. Passes. (Existing `check-taunts.mjs` still green.)

## Owed live pass
Taunt from a phone (iOS sound actually plays), hear it directionally on a second device, spam cut-off
with the menu staying open, stop button kills it, ✕ closes without playing. Then confirm dropping real
clips + manifest lines needs ZERO code change. **For the death fix:** kill a taunting prop mid-track
both as another player AND as the dying prop, confirm instant silence on both screens.
